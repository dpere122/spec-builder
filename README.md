# Spec Builder

A split-pane Markdown specification builder application. Write Markdown on the left, see a live rendered preview on the right. Features a native application menu bar with file management (New, Open, Save) and an About dialog.

## Architecture

- **Main Process** (`src/main.ts`): Electron entry point. Creates a 1200x800 BrowserWindow with context isolation, builds the application menu (File, Help), and handles file dialogs (Open/Save) and disk I/O via IPC.
- **Preload Script** (`src/preload.ts`): Secure bridge between main and renderer processes using `contextBridge`. Exposes IPC channels for menu actions: `onNew`, `onOpen`, `onSavePrompt`, `onSaveDone`, `saveContent`.
- **Renderer Process** (`src/renderer.ts`): Wires up `marked` to render Markdown from the editor textarea into the preview pane in real-time. Listens for menu IPC events to handle New (clear editor), Open (load file content), and Save (send content to main process).
- **Type Declarations** (`src/global.d.ts`): Global TypeScript augmentation so `window.electronAPI` is recognized in the renderer.
- **UI** (`src/index.html` + `src/styles.css`): Flexbox split-pane layout with styled Markdown preview output.

## Application Menu

| Menu | Items | Accelerators |
|---|---|---|
| **File** | New — clear the editor | `Ctrl+N` / `Cmd+N` |
| | Open... — open a Markdown file | `Ctrl+O` / `Cmd+O` |
| | Save... — save current content (saves to the open file directly, or prompts for a new path if unsaved) | `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S` |
| | Quit — close the application | `Ctrl+Q` / `Cmd+Q` |
| **Help** | About — show app info dialog | — |

### IPC Flow

- **New**: Main process sends `menu:new` → renderer clears editor and preview.
- **Open**: Main process shows file dialog → reads file → sends `menu:open` with `{ filePath, content }` → renderer loads content.
- **Save**: If a file is currently open, saves directly to that path; otherwise shows a save dialog → sends `menu:save-prompt` with `filePath` → renderer sends `save-content` with editor text → main process writes file → sends `menu:save-done`.

## Themes

Accessed via **Help → Themes...** in the application menu, the theme picker opens a modal dialog with four built-in themes:

| Theme | Description |
|---|---|
| **Light** | Clean white background with dark text |
| **Dark** | Dark background with light text for low-light environments |
| **Sepia** | Warm, paper-like tones to reduce eye strain |
| **High Contrast** | Maximum contrast (black background, bright text) for accessibility |

Each theme applies CSS custom properties to the editor, preview pane, and UI chrome. Selections are persisted via `localStorage` so the chosen theme is restored on startup.

### Theme IPC Flow

- **Open Picker**: Main process sends `menu:themes` → renderer shows the theme modal.
- **Select Theme**: Renderer calls `selectTheme(themeName)` → sends `menu:select-theme` with the theme name → main process acknowledges → renderer applies CSS variables and persists the choice.
